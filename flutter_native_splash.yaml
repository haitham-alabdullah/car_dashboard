  # todo : configure the ios to run the splash screen
  # iOS setup #
  # iOS is a bit tricky, so hang tight, it might look scary but most of the steps are just a single click, explained as much as possible to lower the possibility of mistakes.

  # When you run the new command, you will need to open xCode and follow the steps bellow:

  # Assumption

  # In order for this setup to work, you would already have 3 different schemes setup; production, acceptance and development.
  # Preparation

  # Open the iOS Flutter project in Xcode (open the Runner.xcworkspace)
  # Find the newly created Storyboard files at the same location where the original is {project root}/ios/Runner/Base.lproj
  # Select all of them and drag and drop into Xcode, directly to the left hand side where the current LaunchScreen.storyboard is located already
  # After you drop your files there Xcode will ask you to link them, make sure you select 'Copy if needed'
  # This part is done, you have linked the newly created storyboards in your project.
  # xCode

  # Xcode still doesn't know how to use them, so we need to specify for all the current flavors (schemes) which file to use and to use that value inside the Info.plist file.

  # Open the iOS Flutter project in Xcode (open the Runner.xcworkspace)
  # Click the Runner project in the top left corner (usually the first item in the list)
  # In the middle part of the screen, on the left side, select the Runner target
  # On the top part of the screen select Build Settings
  # Make sure that 'All' and 'Combined' are selected
  # Next to 'Combine' you have a '+' button, press it and select 'Add User-Defined Setting'
  # Once you do that Xcode will create a new variable for you to name. Suggestion is to name it LAUNCH_SCREEN_STORYBOARD
  # Once you do that, you will have the option to define a specific name for each flavor (scheme) that you have defined in the project. Make sure that you input the exact name of the LaunchScreen.storyboard that was created by this tool
  # Example: If you have a flavor Development, there is a Storyboard created name LaunchScreenDevelopment.storyboard, please add that name (without the storyboard part) to the variable value next to the flavor value
  # After you finish with that, you need to update Info.plist file to link the newly created variable so that it's used correctly
  # Open the Info.plist file
  # Find the entry called 'Launch screen interface file base name'
  # The default value is 'LaunchScreen', change that to the variable name that you create previously. If you follow these steps exactly, it would be LAUNCH_SCREEN_STORYBOARD, so input this $(LAUNCH_SCREEN_STORYBOARD)
  # And your done!

  # This package generates native code to customize Flutter's default white native splash screen
  # with background color and splash image.
  # Customize the parameters below, and run the following command in the terminal:
  # flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
  # To restore Flutter's default white splash screen, run the following command in the terminal:
  # flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:remove

  # color or background_image is the only required parameter.  Use color to set the background
  # of your splash screen to a solid color.  Use background_image to set the background of your
  # splash screen to a png image.  This is useful for gradients. The image will be stretch to the
  # size of the app. Only one parameter can be used, color and background_image cannot both be set.
  # color: "#42a5f5"
  #background_image: "assets/background.png"

  # Optional parameters are listed below.  To enable a parameter, uncomment the line by removing
  # the leading # character.

  # The image parameter allows you to specify an image used in the splash screen.  It must be a
  # png file and should be sized for 4x pixel density.
  #image: assets/splash.png

  # The branding property allows you to specify an image used as branding in the splash screen.
  # It must be a png file. Currently, it is only supported for Android < v12 and iOS.
  #branding: assets/dart.png

  # To position the branding image at the bottom of the screen you can use bottom, bottomRight,
  # and bottomLeft. The default values is bottom if not specified or specified something else.
  #branding_mode: bottom

  # The color_dark, background_image_dark, image_dark, branding_dark are parameters that set the background
  # and image when the device is in dark mode. If they are not specified, the app will use the
  # parameters from above. If the image_dark parameter is specified, color_dark or
  # background_image_dark must be specified.  color_dark and background_image_dark cannot both be
  # set.
  #color_dark: "#042a49"
  #background_image_dark: "assets/dark-background.png"
  #image_dark: assets/splash-invert.png
  #branding_dark: assets/dart_dark.png

  # Android 12 handles the splash screen differently than previous versions.  Please visit
  # https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/splash-screen
  # Following are Android 12 specific parameter.
  # android_12:
  # The image parameter sets the splash screen icon image.  If this parameter is not specified,
  # the app's launcher icon will be used instead.
  # Please note that the splash screen will be clipped to a circle on the center of the screen.
  # App icon with an icon background: This should be 960×960 pixels, and fit within a circle
  # 640 pixels in diameter.
  # App icon without an icon background: This should be 1152×1152 pixels, and fit within a circle
  # 768 pixels in diameter.
  #image: assets/android12splash.png

  # Splash screen background color.
  #color: "#42a5f5"

  # App icon background color.
  #icon_background_color: "#111111"

  # The image_dark parameter and icon_background_color_dark set the image and icon background
  # color when the device is in dark mode. If they are not specified, the app will use the
  # parameters from above.
  #image_dark: assets/android12splash-invert.png
  #color_dark: "#042a49"
  #icon_background_color_dark: "#eeeeee"

  # The android, ios and web parameters can be used to disable generating a splash screen on a given
  # platform.
  #android: false
  #ios: false
  #web: false

  # The position of the splash image can be set with android_gravity, ios_content_mode, and
  # web_image_mode parameters.  All default to center.
  #
  # android_gravity can be one of the following Android Gravity (see
  # https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Gravity): bottom, center,
  # center_horizontal, center_vertical, clip_horizontal, clip_vertical, end, fill, fill_horizontal,
  # fill_vertical, left, right, start, or top.
  #android_gravity: center
  #
  # ios_content_mode can be one of the following iOS UIView.ContentMode (see
  # https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/contentmode): scaleToFill,
  # scaleAspectFit, scaleAspectFill, center, top, bottom, left, right, topLeft, topRight,
  # bottomLeft, or bottomRight.
  #ios_content_mode: center
  #
  # web_image_mode can be one of the following modes: center, contain, stretch, and cover.
  #web_image_mode: center

  # The screen orientation can be set in Android with the android_screen_orientation parameter.
  # Valid parameters can be found here:
  # https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#screen
  #android_screen_orientation: sensorLandscape

  # To hide the notification bar, use the fullscreen parameter.  Has no effect in web since web
  # has no notification bar.  Defaults to false.
  # NOTE: Unlike Android, iOS will not automatically show the notification bar when the app loads.
  #       To show the notification bar, add the following code to your Flutter app:
  #       WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  #       SystemChrome.setEnabledSystemUIOverlays([SystemUiOverlay.bottom, SystemUiOverlay.top]);
  #fullscreen: true

  # If you have changed the name(s) of your info.plist file(s), you can specify the filename(s)
  # with the info_plist_files parameter.  Remove only the # characters in the three lines below,
  # do not remove any spaces:
  #info_plist_files:
  #  - 'ios/Runner/Info-Debug.plist'
  #  - 'ios/Runner/Info-Release.plist'
